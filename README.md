## Overview

It's fully compatible with both the standard WordPress editor and the Elementor page builder.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Does this plugin work with custom post types?**  No, this plugin is currently designed to work only with standard WordPress posts ('post' post type).
*   **Can I customize the appearance of the links?**  Yes, but you'll need to use CSS.  The plugin applies inline styling (`text-decoration: none;` to remove underlines), but you can override this (and add other styles) with CSS rules targeted at `<a>` tags within your post content. You may need to use a more specific CSS selector depending on your theme.
*   **Why only link the first instance of each tag?** Linking only the first instance improves readability and prevents over-linking, which can be distracting for readers.
*   **The links aren't working! What do I do?**
    *   Make sure you have tags properly assigned to your posts.
    *   Clear your browser cache and any caching plugins you are using.
    *   Deactivate and reactivate the plugin to ensure it's properly initialized.
    *   Check for conflicts with other plugins by temporarily deactivating them.
